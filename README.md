#Costpoint SQL Scripts

This repository is a collection of various SQL scripts useful for working
with Deltek Costpoint.

To use them, you will need to establish a connection to your ERP database via 
a tool such as Microsoft SQL Server Managent Studio.

Note that all scripts are written for SQL Server.  These should work for 
Oracle databases, though may require some modifications depending on the script.
