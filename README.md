#Costpoint SQL Scripts

This repository is a collection of various SQL scripts useful for working
with Deltek Costpoint.

To use them, you will need to establish a connection to your ERP database via 
a tool such as Microsoft SQL Server Managent Studio.

Note that all scripts are written for SQL Server.  These should work for 
Oracle databases, though may require some modifications depending on the script.

Note that in most cases I've attempted to set the scripts up for general use.
However, I use these on a regular basis, and they are subject to modification
from time to time as required to address specific problems I may be working with.
You may also need to make some modifications to search terms, filters, etc in 
order to achieve the results you want with your data.
